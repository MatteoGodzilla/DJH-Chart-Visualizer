# DJH-Chart-Visualizer
This is a Reaper plugin that visually renders DJ Hero 2 custom tracks inside Reaper.

## How to use
Instructions updated as of Reaper v7.47
- Download this project by either cloning or downloading as zip to a known location
    - in the case of zip, extract the files so `main.lua` is directly accessible
- In Reaper:
    - Go to `Actions` -> `Show action list...` -> `ReaScript: Run ReaScript (EEL2 or Lua)...` (pro tip: use the filter bar on the top left)
    - Navigate to where you have downloaded the project and select `main.lua`
    - Click `Open` 
- Profit

Once you have opened the visualizer once, you can also open it with `Actions` -> `Show action list...` -> `ReaScript: Run last ReaScript (EEL2 or Lua)`, skipping a step.
